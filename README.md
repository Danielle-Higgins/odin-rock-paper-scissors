This project keeps track of how many times the user wins and how many times the computer wins. First, I wrote a function that gets the choice of the computer using a random number generator. Then I created a function that plays a round of rock, paper, scissors and increments the number of times the user or computer wins. The user has access to three buttons which represent rock, paper scissors. When you click on one of the buttons, the play round function is called and plays a round based on the user selection and the computer selection. The game will tell you the score and whoever gets to five points first wins.

## Optimizations

If/when I improve this project, I want to start by making it responsive. I also want to make it to where the user doesn't have to reload to play again, they should be able to click on a button instead.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that you can use emojis in your code. I got more practice with problem solving. Separation of concerns.
