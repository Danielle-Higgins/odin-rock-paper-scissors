# odin-rock-paper-scissors
This project is a rock, paper scissors game written in JavaScript. I added a User Interface to make the game more interactive.
## Skills
Skills I will have demonstrated once completed:

- Basic HTML, same as listed in the [odin-recipes](https://github.com/Danielle-Higgins/odin-recipes) project
- Basic CSS, same as listed in the [odin-recipes](https://github.com/Danielle-Higgins/odin-recipes) project along with
    - The box model
    - Flexbox
- JavaScript Fundamentals
    - DOM Manipulation
    - Events

## Thoughts
This project wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Creating the UI itself was a good refresher for practicing basic HTML and CSS. With the logic, I still need to practice my problem solving skills and I need more practice with DOM manipulation and events. But overall, I learned a lot and I can't wait to dive deeper and practice these concepts more!
